# Pandemic-Simulation-Unity-
A project I completed for my final year dissertation. It is a pandemic 'simulation' with an emphasis on performance rather than accuracy. I included the report in case it interests anyone.

There's a lot of boilerplate included in the repository, purely to make it work with the Unity editor. The main bulk of the project is in the Assets/Scripts directory. For an .exe file, download the main/Executable directory and run 'Pandemic Simulation.exe'.
